- **State Estimation for Timed Discrete Event Systems with Communication Delays**

**摘要**: In this paper, we investigate the state estimation problem for timed discrete event systems with communication delays. The problem is how to estimate the current state under the uncertainties caused by partial observations and random observation delays. We construct an augmented automaton after analyzing the influence mechanism of random observation delays existed between the supervisor and the timed discrete event system. The augmented automaton includes all the possible observation trajectories and the corresponding state reached with any observation trajectory. For the augmented automaton, we construct a delayed observer and then propose a state estimation algorithm to obtain the correct state estimate for any observation trajectory.

- **Predictive Supervisory Control for Timed Discrete Event Systems under Communication Delays**

**摘要**: In many cyber-physical systems, controllers and plants are located at different sites. Communications between a controller and a plant are carried out over a wired or wireless communication network. Communication delays in such systems must be addressed when designing controllers. In this paper, we model a cyber-physical system as a timed discrete event system. We investigate predictive supervisory control of timed discrete event systems with communication delays in both observation channel and control channel. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an admissible networked supervisor that ensures the language generated by the closed-loop system equals a given specification language. An example is given to illustrate the results.

- **State Estimation and Supervisor Synthesis for Timed Discrete Event Systems under Communication Delays and Losses**

**摘要**: In many networked systems, controllers and plants are located at different sites. Communications between a con- troller and a plant are carried out over a wired or wireless communication network. Communication delays and losses must be addressed when investigating such systems. In this paper, we model a plant as a timed discrete event system. We investigate the state estimation problem and supervisory control problem for timed discrete event systems under communication delays and losses. We propose an augmented automaton technique for state estimation and supervisory control. Based on the technique, we construct an automaton which includes all possible observed trajectories and the corresponding states reached by these observed trajectories. We then construct its observer which can be used to calculate all the state estimates for all the observations. For the supervisory control problem, we derive the sufficient and necessary conditions under which the supervisory control problem has solutions. We also propose a state-estimate- based predictive supervisor which ensures the language generated by the closed-loop system equals a given specification language. The state-estimate-based predictive supervisor can be easily implemented using the observer. Examples are given to illustrate the results.
